### System Requirements
Windows machine must meet the following requirements to successfully install the docker:

**With WSL 2 backend** <br/>
Type **winver** in RUN to check the version of the installed windows.

- Windows 11 64-bit: Home or Pro version 21H2 or higher,\
  or Enterprise or Education version 21H2 or     higher
- Windows 10 64-bit: Home or Pro 21H1 (build 19043) or higher,\

 **Hardware Requirements to run WSL 2 on Windows 10 or Windows 11** <br/>  

- 64-bit processor with Second Level Address Translation (SLAT)

- 4GB system RAM

- BIOS-level hardware virtualization support must be enabled in the \
  BIOS settings. For more information, see [Virtualization](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/troubleshoot/topics/)

## Installation with Batch and Configuring Devices
1. Download the [enable_feature.bat](enable_feature.bat) and run it as administrator.
- Reboot your system.

4. Open [cam2ip.exe](cam2ip-1.6-64bit-cv/cam2ip.exe) see "Listening on: 56000" 
 - IP stream will be on `http://localhost:56000/mjpeg`

 You can now go back to [Installation Page](../README.md). 



<!-- ## Enable WSL 2 Feature
**Follow the steps given below to install WSL(Windows subsystem Linux):**

1.  Enabling the Virtual Machine Platform
```
dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart
```
2. Enabling the Windows Subsystem for Linux

dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart
```
  Restart your system. <br/>

## Docker Installation for Windows Systems
(Supported for Windows 10 and 11 only) <br/>
**Note**: It is recommended to use WSL2 as backend. <br/>

### Steps to Install Docker from Command line on Windows:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Note**

After downloading [Docker Desktop Installer.exe](https://desktop.docker.com/win/main/amd64/Docker%20Desktop%20Installer.exe), run the following command in `cmd` to <br/> 
Install Docker Desktop:
```
"Docker Desktop Installer.exe" install
```
If youâ€™re using PowerShell you should run it as:
```
Start-Process 'path\to\Docker Desktop Installer.exe' -Wait install
```
And the install command accepts the following flags:

-  `--quiet`: Suppresses information output when running the installer
-  `--accept-license`: Accepts the [Docker Subscription Service Agreement](https://www.docker.com/legal/docker-subscription-service-agreement/) now, rather than requiring it to be accepted when the application is first run.
- `--backend=[backend name]`: selects the backend to use for Docker Desktop, hyper-v or wsl-2 (default)

If your admin account is different to your user account, you must add the user to the docker-users group:
```
net localgroup docker-users <user> /add
``` -->
